# Community-Fibre-WHW03CFv2

This repo has been made for people like me who wanted to flash retail Linksys firmware on the Community Fibre Linksys Velop WHW03CFv2 router. If you have stumbled across this repo then you most likely are aware that the firmware provided by Community Fibre does not allow retail firmware to be flashed on to it. This repo is your soloution, I have not seen anyone release to the public a method of 'unlocking' this router so I will.
